	<p><span class="big-text typewriter">Hello! I'm Braeden Fong.</span></p>
 <p>Hello! I'm Braeden Fong, and I'm studying a combined major in Business and Computer Science (BUCS) at UBC Sauder. In the coming future, I am hoping to work somewhere in the tech industry.</p>
<p>I have experience as a Teaching Assistant for CPSC 203, a Python data structures and algorithms class. In this role, I ran lab sessions for over 30 students and helped them understand complex programming concepts which improved my ability to communicate technical information clearly. </p>
<p>In addition, I am also a certified lifeguard and formerly worked at a pool for the City of Burnaby until May 2020. As a lifeguard, I learned strong leadership and communication skills.
